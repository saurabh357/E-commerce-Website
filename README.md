4. Web form or shopping cart

Your Web Form/Shopping Cart:
If you choose to use WooCommerce or an E-commerce Builder a shopping cart is included, but you don't need to activate it using a merchant account or credit card
If you create an HTML site it needs to have a Web form or a shopping cart, but it does not need to be connected to a merchant account.
Web forms are pages that have text fields and other clickable buttons, etc. that can be used to order products. When you submit the information, it will be sent via email or some other Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to you, the business owner/manager.
if you choose to have a shopping cart and are using Shopify, an easy option is Shopify Payments. You can even test without charging a card using test mode. Shopify provides easy to follow instructions to set up and test Shopify Payments.
